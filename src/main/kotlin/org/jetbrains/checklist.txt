2. Input Validation
- valid input values
- invalid input values (+ correct error messages + no crashes)
- boundary conditions: minimum or maximum input values/ edge cases

3. Performance/Scalability
- Test on large datasets/many requests
- response time/resource utilization under different load conditions
- handling memory-intensive operations efficiently (no excessive memory consumption/leaks)
- garbage collection + closing files/database connections

4. Logging and Error Handling
- logs are correct/informative, include errors/warnings/info messages

5. Documentation
- documentation/help messages

- combinations of command-line arguments

7.Compatibility
- different operating systems + file systems
- different JVM versions
- different run environments (?)

8. Concurrency
- multi-threaded environment
- concurrent environment
- shared resources are accessed and modified safely (no race conditions/deadlocks)
- synchronization + thread-safe practices rules

9. Integration
